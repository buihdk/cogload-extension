Cognitive Load Visualizer – Privacy Policy Cognitive Load Visualizer does not
collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data. All
cognitive load analysis is performed entirely on the user’s local machine. The
extension does not send any webpage content, browsing activity, or interaction
data to external servers. The extension uses Chrome’s storage API solely to
store ephemeral analysis results locally to display them in the popup interface.
These stored values are non-personal and are cleared automatically. No
analytics, tracking scripts, or third-party services are used. If you have
questions, you may contact the developer at: buihdk@gmail.com
